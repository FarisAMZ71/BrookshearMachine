add  save and load
live machine_code generation

what command could be in the assembler 
which can be assembled into more than one brookshear instructin eg sub, mul

maximum expadibality usin minimum instruction
branch, branch and return, stack, linking

add colors from machine codde to memory
look at assembly books first chapters

look at color coding(accessability + consistancy)
make mobile friendly

instruction extending (if 1111 then subset of instructions)
standards for function calls in assembly

link registers + stacks
paging
instruction extending

push multiple registers in one instruction

(branch and link+ exchange)
run speed 
save program after closure
